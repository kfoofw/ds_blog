I"@l<p>As part of the Masters of Data Science syllabus, we had to pick up Altair as part of our Visualisation toolkit for the Python language. For my personal dataset choice, I decided to perform EDA on OkCupid’s dataset on the user database.</p>

<p><strong>1. OkCupid Dataset</strong></p>

<p>The dataset can be found in R as part of a library package. All the data variables were obtained from OkCupid’s platform using their user profiles. Although the data was obtained from the OkCupid platform, names were removed to eliminate any direct form of identification. The dataset was also cleaned up by Albert Kim and Adriana Escobedo-Land, and subsequently entered into the Journal of Statistics Education 2015 for a Statistics and Data Science introductory course. It is currently available on CRAN as a R package (“okcupiddata”). The dataset package can be found in the following: (https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/okcupiddata/index.html).</p>

<p>This dataset was collated based on 59,946 users in June 26 2012 who met the following criteria:<br />
    - Living within 25 miles of San Francisco. <br />
    - Active profiles as of June 26 2012<br />
    - Were online in the previous year<br />
    - Had at least one picture in their profile</p>

<p>The dataset comprises of 22 variables in total that describe their user’s profile:<br />
    1. <strong>age</strong>: Age of the user as of June 2012  <br />
    2. <strong>body_type</strong>: Self-rated body type based on OkCupid’s platform options. <br />
    3. <strong>diet</strong>: Diet type based on OkCupid’s platform options. <br />
    4. <strong>drinks</strong>: Drinking habits of user<br />
    5. <strong>drugs</strong>: Drug habits of user <br />
    6. <strong>education</strong>: Highest education attained by user <br />
    7. <strong>ethnicity</strong>: Ethnicity declaration input by user <br />
    8. <strong>height</strong>: Height in inches <br />
    9. <strong>income</strong>: Annual income<br />
    10. <strong>job</strong>: Current job<br />
    11. <strong>last_online</strong>: Last session of log-in by user on OkCupid platform<br />
    12. <strong>location</strong>: Location of residence<br />
    13. <strong>offspring</strong>: Number of children based on OkCupid’s platform options. <br />
    14. <strong>orientation</strong>: Sexual orientation based on OkCupid’s platform options. <br />
    15. <strong>pets</strong>: Preference and ownership of cats and/or dogs. Based on OkCupid’s platform options. <br />
    16. <strong>religion</strong>: Religious affiliation based on OkCupid’s platform options<br />
    17. <strong>sex</strong>: Gender<br />
    18. <strong>sign</strong>: Astrological signs based on OkCupid’s platform options<br />
    19. <strong>smokes</strong>: Smoking habits based on OkCupid’s platform options<br />
    20. <strong>speaks</strong>: Languages spoken by user<br />
    21. <strong>status</strong>: Relationship status<br />
    22. <strong>essay0</strong>: Response to first essay question (my self summary), trimmed to 140 characters.</p>

<p><strong>2. OkCupid Dataset EDA</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at some of features with Altair, Pandas and numpy loaded. Since Altair has a default parameter that prevents you from working with larger datasets, we have to turn off that parameter by disabling the max rows default.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import numpy as np

alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The gender breakdown comprises of 35,829 males and 24,117 females.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    y = alt.Y("sex:N"),
    x = alt.X("count(sex):Q", title = "Number of users"),
    color = alt.X("sex:N")
).properties(title = "Gender breakdown", height = 100)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p align="center">
&lt;img src="/assets/img/post_3/gender_eda.png" /img&gt; 
</p>

<p>What is more interesting to me is also the topic of sexual orientation. 51,606 users identify as straight, 5,573 users identify as gay, and 2,767 identify as bisexual.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    x = alt.X("orientation:N"),
    y = alt.Y("count(orientation):Q", title = "Number of users"),
    color = alt.X("orientation:N")
).properties(title = "Sexual orientation breakdown")
</code></pre></div></div>
<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_3/orientation_eda.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<p>The number of users who identify as bisexuals are the lowest, and is about half the size of users who identify themselves as gay. Let’s take a look at the sexual orientation breakdown by gender.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    x = alt.X("orientation:N"),
    y = alt.Y("count(orientation):Q", title = "Number of users"),
    color = alt.X("orientation:N")
).facet(
    facet = "sex:N",
    columns = 2
).properties(title = "Sexual orientation breakdown by Gender")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_3/orientation_by_gender_eda.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon is shown: there are more women who identify as bisexuals than women who identify as gays, while the reverse is true for men. Also to note, roughly about 1 in 6 women (roughly 4000 to 24,000 total women) identify as either bisexuals or gays, while for men, the ratio is about 1 in 7 (roughly 5000 to 35,000 total men).</p>

<p>Perhaps women are in general more sexually liberal in that sense, while men are more fixated on the stereotypes that is enforced by society. The backlash of identifying as non-straight is probably less for women compared to men in a patriarchal sociey. Granted, this data was from 2012 and the user population was from San Francisco. A lot of time has passed since then, and the frontiers of gender norms have changed drastically especially with the advent of LGBTQ and also with drag becoming mainstream.</p>

<p>The age breakdown is shown as below:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    x = alt.X("age:Q"),
    y = alt.Y("count(age):Q")
).properties(title = "Age breakdown", height = 200)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_3/orientation_by_gender_eda.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<p>The lowest age is 18 years old while the oldest age is actually 110 years (which is probably an outlier). The mean age is around 32.3 years old. As shown, most of the users are roughly between 20 to 40, with about one-third/one-fourth ranging beyond 40 years old.</p>

<p>Out of the 60,000 users, only 11,504 declared their incomes. Thus, the following breakdown represents a sample of the population and might not be truly representative.</p>

<p>alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
    x = alt.X(“income:Q”),
    y = alt.Y(“count(income):Q”)
).properties(title = “Income breakdown”, height = 200)</p>

<p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>

<p>As part of the visualisation lab, we have to explore either a Descriptive or an Exploratory type of research question. To put things into some perspective:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Descriptive research questions seek to provide a summary of the dataset. No interpretation of the results are required since it is geared towards a particular summary statistic.</li>
  <li>Exploratory research questions are those that provide an initial analysis for any patterns, trends or relationships. These questions can be viewed as a “primer” for more indepth hypothetical research questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>My objectives in this exercise are to answer the following research questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the age distribution of men and women on OkCupid? (Descriptive)</li>
  <li>Do people who identify as Agnostic/Atheist have a higher tendency to drink compared to those who identify with a religion affiliation? (Exploratory)</li>
</ol>

<p>In <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>, it is not particularly easy to create plots related to density/ridgeline/violin plots compared to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ggplot</code> package in R. Thus, my motivations for this lab actually stems from trying to learn the density/ridgeline plots, especially for the Descriptive research question. I also wanted to familiarise myself with using direct data transformation within <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Descriptive Challenge: What is the age distribution of men and women on OkCupid?</strong></p>

<p>Note that for this visualisation, I intended to create two sub-visualisations. For both charts, binning of the data was required. As part of my learning objectives, I approached it from either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>data wrangling via Pandas before using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> to plot</li>
  <li>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> to perform wrangling/transformation before plotting</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is my wrangling code with respect to Pandas before using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> to create a visualisation.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Filter out users whose age is greater than 90 as they are outliers

data = data.query("age &lt; 90")

# Dropping all common rows with NA
data_gender_age = data[["sex","age"]].dropna()

# Renaming "sex" column observations
data_gender_age["sex"] = np.select(
    [
        data_gender_age["sex"] == "m", 
        data_gender_age["sex"] == "f"
    ], 
    [
        "Male", "Female"
    ], 
default = "0")

# Create necessary bins
bins = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80]
bin_labels = [15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80]
data_gender_age["bin"] = pd.cut(data_gender_age["age"], bins = bins)

# Relabelling bins for graph reference labelling
data_gender_age["bin_label"] = data_gender_age["bin"].map(lambda x: str(x.left) + " - " + str(x.right))

# Find the lower range of bin for plotting
data_gender_age["bin"] = data_gender_age["bin"].map(lambda x: x.left)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the necessary data wrangling/processing completed, we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> to create the visualisation. My target visualisation comprises of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A population pyramid plot for each gender</li>
  <li>Overlayed density plots of each gender for comparison</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is the code for the population pyramid plot:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>base = alt.Chart(data_gender_age).transform_aggregate(
    value = "count()", groupby=["sex", "bin_label"]
)

                        scheme = "accent")

left = base.transform_filter(
    alt.datum.sex == "Female"

                     legend = None,
                      scale = color_scale
                     )
).mark_bar().properties(title = "Female")

middle = base.encode(
    y = alt.Y("bin_label:O", axis = None),
    text = alt.Text( "bin_label:O")

right = base.transform_filter(
    alt.datum.sex == "Male"

pyramid_plot = alt.concat(left, middle, right, spacing = 5).properties(
title = "User distribution across age and gender")
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Note that we can save the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> Chart object as a variable. This is useful for multiple plots concatenation.</p>

<p>Up next is the code for creating the density plot. In this approach to create binned data, I utilised <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>’s data transformation functions. This is actually much harder to perform because there is no actual “feedback” of how the transformed data looks like. Based on my limited experience with Altair so far, I don’t think it is possible to extract out the transformed data, and thus, you need to be very strong conceptually in terms of the transformation steps required if you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>’s transformation.</p>

<p>As part of my learning and future reference, I have embedded comments to illustrate/describe what each transformation is for. Hopefully this guides any user trying to learn the data transformation techniques of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>.</p>

<p>After creating both intermediary Chart objects <code class="highlighter-rouge">pyramid_plot</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">density_plot</code>, we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>’s concatenation to orientate the sub-plots and create a combined visualisation.</p>

<p>Note that the “&amp;” operator is used here to indicate a vertical concatenation. For horizontal concatenation, you can use the  “|” operator.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is to be distinguished from the “+” operator, which adds plot layers on top of each other on the same Chart (which is similar to the concept used in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ggplot</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>As shown in the following code, we can configure the particular parameters of the overall concatenated plot.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(pyramid_plot &amp; density_plot).configure_title(

</p>

<p>The population pyramid plot gives a good visual sense of the absolute users by gender, which depicts that there tends to be less women than men on OkCupid. To put things into perspective, the overlayed density plots provide a calibrated basis for fair comparison.</p>

<p>Based on my 1st research question, there are generally less women than men on the OkCupid platform. However, the normalised age distribution across both genders are largely the same. One minor difference is that for men, there seems to be a higher concentration of males between the age range of 24 to 34 compared to women (6.5% versus 5.5%). On the other hand, we can observe a higher percentage of older women in the older age bins (beyond age 48) compared to men.</p>

<p><strong>Exploratory Challenge: Do people who identify as Agnostic/Atheist have a higher tendency to drink compared to those who identify with a religion affiliation?</strong></p>

<p>For the purpose of this research question, we need to understand the related data, namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drinking Habits</li>
  <li>Religion</li>
</ul>

<p>For Drinking Habits, the different types of listed user habits are as listed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“socially”,</li>
  <li>“often”,</li>
  <li>“not at all”,</li>
  <li>“rarely”,</li>
  <li>“very often”,</li>
  <li>“desperately”,</li>
  <li>with the remaining as NA.</li>
</ul>

<p>As shown, the drinking options are treated as somewhat Ordinal data, with some semblance of a progressive scale in terms of drinking tendencies.</p>

<p>For Religion, there are a total of 46 types of religion affliation options, which are comprised of a combination of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Religion types (Atheism, Agnosticism, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islamism, Catholicism)</li>
  <li>Strength of beliefs (very serious, somewhat serious, not too serious, laughing about it)</li>
</ul>

<p>For this research question, we will ignore the strength of beliefs, and simplify users according to their core religion affliation types.</p>

<p>Below is the data wrangling code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Religion impact on drinking
data_religion_drinks = data[["religion","drinks"]].dropna()

data_religion_drinks.head()

# Classify if atheist/agnostic

# Renormalising data
# Performing count of data based on two tiered grouping
data_religion_drinks_group_count = data_religion_drinks.groupby(["agnostic_atheist","drinks"]).size().reset_index()

# Renaming column as the last col name was rendered "0" with reset_index
data_religion_drinks_group_count.columns = ["agnostic_atheist", "drinks", "counts"]

# Normalising to get percentages based on 1 tiered groupby on "agnostic_atheist"
data_religion_drinks_group_count["percentages"] = data_religion_drinks_group_count.groupby("agnostic_atheist")["counts"].apply(lambda x: x/sum(x) * 100)

# Relabeling "drinks" to Camel case for visualisation
data_religion_drinks_group_count["drinks"] = np.select(
    [
        data_religion_drinks_group_count["drinks"] == "not at all",

<p>To plot ordinal data, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">R ggplot</code>, one needs to consider the <code class="highlighter-rouge">factor</code> levels of the grouped data. In <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>, one needs to employ a similar technique as well. Besides the requirement to treat the x-axis data as Ordinal, I also had to create a separate column for the “drinks_ordering” based on my semantics understanding of drinking habits, which will be used as reference in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> Chart. For more details, refer to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> plotting code.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Drinks level ordering

<p>Based on my 2nd research question, the users’ selection options for drinking habits are ordinal, but based on the semantics used in the options, we can classify them into Lower and Higher Drinking tendencies. Also for reiteration, the comparison is among Non-religious users (Atheist, Agnostics) versus Religious users (Buddhism, Islamism, Catholicism, etc).</p>

<p>With the aggregation of drinking habits options, it allows us to see that users with a core religion affiliation tend to drink less.</p>

<p>From the graph, the percentage of “social” drinking remained roughly the same. On the other hand, the main difference in drinking habits between the religious versus non-religious users arise from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an increase in “Not at all” and “Rarely” options for religious users,</li>
  <li>a decrease in “Often” options for non-religious users.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, we can probably speculate/attribute the reduction in drinking habits for religious users could be due to certain religious beliefs, where sometimes drinking alcohol can be seen as irresponsible or even hedonistic behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Learning Objectives</strong></p>

<p>Based on this exercise, I managed to achieve some of my personal learning goals that I set for myself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarising myself with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code>’s data transformation functions</li>
  <li>Learning the steps for creating a density plot</li>
  <li>Learning how to present ordinal data in an ordered fashion through a sorting variable.</li>
  <li>It is better to perform direct data transformation on your dataframe before sending it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Altair</code> for plotting.</li>
</ul>
