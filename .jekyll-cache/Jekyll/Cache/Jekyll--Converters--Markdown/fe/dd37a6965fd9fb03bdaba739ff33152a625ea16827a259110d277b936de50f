I"(<p>If you have been following the NBA 2019/20 season, you may have heard
about Andre Drummondâ€™s recent trade and the lack of interest in him by
other teams during the phase of trade rumours. A center like Andre
Drummond has strong post-up offensive skills and rebounding capabilities
but it may not fit the modern NBA game that has a demand on 3 point
shooting and floor spacing. A motivation for this analysis topic is to
verify how the big men positions have evolved to fit the current systems
with respect to their 3 point shooting abilities.</p>
