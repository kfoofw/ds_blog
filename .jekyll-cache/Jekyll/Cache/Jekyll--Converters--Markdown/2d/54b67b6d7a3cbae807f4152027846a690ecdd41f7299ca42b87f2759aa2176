I"M[<p>Contextual bandits (CB) are more granular in terms of the way they use information. Compared to their Multi-armed Bandits (MAB), we utilise contextual information about the observed instance in order to recommend the most effective variant.</p>

<p>Let’s use an example of A/B testing. Assume a website has 3 webpage variants (A, B, C), and the objective is to optimise the click through rate (CTR):</p>
<ul>
  <li>With a MAB approach, the variants are treated similarly, and the objective is to find the webpage that has the highest CTR for all user traffic</li>
  <li>With a CB approach, the variants are treated differently in terms of their effectiveness for specific users. Some users may differ in terms of their age or demographics which creates some form of profile. Such contextual information may be useful for us to recommend the appropriate variant as different variants may be more effective for certain types of users.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, the difference between MABs and CBs can be illustrated by the following philosophies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MABs are created with the “one size fits all” in mind while seeking the most superior solution.</li>
  <li>CBs are created with the concept of having bespoke solutions for different circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="upper-confidence-bound-ucb">Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)</h1>

<p>The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is often phrased as “optimism in the face of uncertainty”. Consider at a given timestep that each arm’s reward function can be perceived as a point estimate based on the average rate of reward as observed. Drawing intuition from confidence intervals, for each point estimate, we can also incorporate some form of uncertainty boundary around the point estimate. In that sense, we have both lower boundary and upper boundary for each arm.</p>

<p>The UCB algorithm is aptly named because we are only concerned with the upper bound, given that we are trying to find the arm with the highest reward rate.</p>

<p>There are different variants of the UCB algorithms but for an illustration, we will take a look at the UCB1 algorithm. In the context of UCB, at each given round of <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> trials, the reward UCB of all arms are represented by the following:</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/ucb_eqn.png" /> 
</p>

<p>For a quick illustration, let’s take a look at a toy example with 5 arms where the reward is binary (1 or 0). As shown in the following screenshot, each arm has an average mean represented by the square, while the confidence bounds (both lower and higher) are indicated by the horizontal lines. The dotted grey line shows the maximum bound among all arms.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/ucb_example1.png" /> 
</p>

<p>For each time step, we pick the arm that has the highest UCB value (estimated mean plus its confidence bound) and we try to observe the reward for that arm only. With each iteration, we update the return average of each arm through the equation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The mean of each arm <code class="highlighter-rouge">μ_i</code> increases with positive reward (1), and decreases with no reward (0)</li>
  <li>The confidence bound is updated by both <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> (number of overall time steps) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">n_i</code> (number of times we picked that arm). In the numerator, we observe the logarithmic time complexity where the boundary increases through <code class="highlighter-rouge">log(n)</code> with more passing time. With the denominator, we can see that the boundary decreases in linear time complexity with <code class="highlighter-rouge">n_i</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm thus explore arms that might not be a good performer which we have high uncertainty about (thus a high UCB), while exploiting arms that have superior average returns but with high certainty.</p>

<h1 id="linucb-disjoint">LinUCB (Disjoint)</h1>

<p>In the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0146">“A Contextual-Bandit Approach to Personalized News Article Recommendation”</a>, Li et al. demonstrated the use of a contextual multi-armed bandit solution where the expected pay off <code class="highlighter-rouge">r_{t,a}</code> of an arm <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> is linear in its context covariates <code class="highlighter-rouge">x_{t,a}</code> at  time <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code>. This is called Linear UCB Disjoint (LinUCB).</p>

<p>A simple example of this is demonstrated by his lecture slides by Assoc Prof Yue Yisong, which can be found <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/courses/cs159/lectures/LinUCB.pdf">here</a>. In the example of a news article recommendation, there are two user groups with their corresponding context (young and old demographics) as shown by the relevant <code class="highlighter-rouge">x_1</code> (young) or <code class="highlighter-rouge">x_2</code> (old) feature vector. Based on the learnt weights <code class="highlighter-rouge">theta</code>, we can perform matrix multiplication to predict the pay off for the recommended article.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/caltech_linucb_lect.png" />
</div>

<p>In matrix formulation, the above statement can be put forth as:</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/ucb_eqn_2.png" /> 
</div>

<p>Simply put, think back about the use of a linear regression model where the response variable for each arm is a reward return based on the input covariates. The coefficients <code class="highlighter-rouge">θ*_a</code> is unknown but with the online learning algorithm, we perform ridge regression to obtain it at each time step.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/ucb_eqn_3.png" /> 
</div>

<p>For simplication of the equation, we can rewrite the above using two variables <code class="highlighter-rouge">A_a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b_a</code>.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_theta_simplified.png" /> 
</div>

<p>where</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_A_defn.png" /> 
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_b_defn.png" /> 
</div>

<p>For more technical details, the ridge regression allows us to view the posterior distribution of the coefficients <code class="highlighter-rouge">p(θ_a)</code> as a Bayesian point estimate with as a Gaussian mean <code class="highlighter-rouge">θhat_a</code> and covariance <code class="highlighter-rouge">A_inv_a</code>.</p>

<p>Building off that, for a given set of covariate inputs <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> at time <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code>, the predicted expected reward return can be formulated as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expected value</li>
</ul>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_mean_defn.png" /> 
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Standard deviation</li>
</ul>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_stddev_defn.png" /> 
</div>

<p>At the crux of the algorithm, we wish to find the arm with the highest UCB at time <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code>.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_eqn_5.png" /> 
</div>

<p>In similar form, this is once again represented by picking the arm based on the sum of :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The mean reward estimate of each arm (red box) and</li>
  <li>The corresponding upper confidence bound (blue box), where <code class="highlighter-rouge">α</code> is a hyper parameter</li>
</ul>

<p>The higher <code class="highlighter-rouge">α</code> is, the wider the confidence bounds become. Thus it results in a higher emphasis placed on exploration instead of exploitation.</p>

<p>The above explanation captures most of the required intuition in the implementation of the LinUCB, while skipping certain technical details of it. Do refer to the actual paper for a deeper dive into it.</p>

<h1 id="linucb-disjoint-implementation-in-python">LinUCB Disjoint Implementation in Python</h1>

<p>With that in mind, let’s take a look at the overall algorithm.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_disjoint_algo.png" /> 
</div>

<p>The algorithm can be broken down into the following phases for each time step <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code> with the corresponding context vector <code class="highlighter-rouge">x_t</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the arm is new, initiate <code class="highlighter-rouge">A_a</code> (d x d identity matrix) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b_a</code> (d by 1 zero vector). d represents the dimensions of the covariates.</li>
  <li>Calculate <code class="highlighter-rouge">theta_a</code> using the ridge regression formula</li>
  <li>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">x_t</code>, calculate the UCB of each arm based on the sum of the expected mean and confidence bound (<code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> * standard deviation)</li>
  <li>Out of all arms, select the arm that has the highest UCB. If there are arms that have the same UCB, randomly pick between them.</li>
  <li>Observe the reward based on the selected arm at time step <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code></li>
  <li>Update information only on <code class="highlighter-rouge">A_chosen_arm</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b_chosen_arm</code> which represents the online training.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, we need 3 objects for the simulation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Class object for each LinUCB disjoint arm</li>
  <li>Class object for the policy of K number of LinUCB disjoint arms</li>
  <li>Function for simulating the policy using a data set to determine the cumulative takeoff rate (ctr) using the LinUCB policy</li>
</ul>

<p>For the data set, we will use the dataset from <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/6998/dataset.txt">here</a>. The data set represents the logged data of a policy for 10,000 lines of observed data for a total of 10 arms and 100 covariates. For each line (which represents a single time step):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first column represents the arm chosen (1 to 10)</li>
  <li>The 2nd column represents the reward function observed for the selected arm (0 or 1)</li>
  <li>The 3rd to last columns represent the 100 covariates</li>
</ul>

<p>The trouble with simulation using a logged data set is that not all time steps will be useful. For example, for a given time step, if the LinUCB policy selects an arm that is not the same arm selected in the logged data, we cannot observe the reward function. Thus, the data for that time step is not relevant.</p>

<p>To circumvent that, we only choose to observe the reward and perform online learning IF AND ONLY IF our policy selects the same arm as the logged data at that particular time step. Otherwise, we will move on to the next time step without any updates. Implicitly, this requires the assumption that the data points for the different time steps are independent of each other. For more details on this methodology of , please refer to the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5956">“Unbiased Offline Evaluation of Contextual-bandit-based News Article Recommendation Algorithms”</a> by Li et al.</p>

<p>To implement the algorithm in Python code, we just need <code class="highlighter-rouge">numpy</code> for the matrix calculations. Along with each code chunk, I added comments to make it more understandable in terms of the algorithm.</p>

<p>Here is the Class object for a single LinUCB Disjoint Arm, which has 3 main methods:</p>

  <li><strong>Initiation</strong>: Create <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> for that arm</li>
  <li><strong>UCB Calculation</strong>: Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">x_t</code> context input at time t, we determine the estimate of <code class="highlighter-rouge">θhat</code>. Subsequently, we calculate the UCB.</li>
  <li><strong>Reward update</strong>: Update information for that arm if it was chosen.</li>

<h1 id="linucb-disjoint-policy-with-varying-alpha-values">LinUCB Disjoint Policy with varying <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> values</h1>

<p>We can now simulate the data to see how the LinUCB performs. For comparison, the benchmark will be based on a random showing of 10 arms of which the CTR will be around 10%. If there is no learning, the CTR will hover at the 10% mark. Based on the data, let’s check out what happens when we specify <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> = 1.5.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{python}">alpha_input = 1.5
data_path = "../data/news_dataset.txt"
aligned_time_steps, cum_rewards, aligned_ctr, policy = ctr_simulator(K_arms = 10, d = 100, alpha = alpha_input, data_path = data_path)
</code></pre>
<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/simulation_alpha_1.5.png" /> 
</div>

<p>As depicted, the CTR starts off on average around 10%. As time progresses, the online learning kicks in that shows an increasing rate of CTR. By the end of the simulation, we observe that the data reaches around 15% CTR. One thing to also note is that out of 10,000 data steps, only about slightly less than 1000 was considered aligned.</p>

<p>Since <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> is a hyperparameter that pre-determines the emphasis of exploration versus exploitation, I will simulate the CTR of <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> = 1.0. This should result in a Policy that has less emphasis on exploring arms with higher uncertainty.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/simulation_alpha_1.0.png" /> 
</div>

<p>As usual, we see that the CTR starts off with around 10% but it increases moderately to the point around time step at 200. Between t = 200 to 600, we observe a plateau in terms of CTR. This is probably the point where the policy is exploring different arms that have similar uncertainty in terms of the UCB. After t = 600, it seems like the policy has evaluated the different arms sufficiently such that the mean estimate for each arm given the context information becomes precise with lower uncertainty. Thereafter, the CTR improves dramatically as the policy recommends the best arm for each context. With a lower <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code>, we see that the CTR improves to the point where it ends at around 22%. Also that the total number of aligned time steps is about 50 more than what it was previously.</p>

<p>For the fun of it, let’s test out what happens at <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> = 0.5.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/simulation_alpha_0.5.png" /> 
</div>

<p>Based on an even lower weightage of exploration, we see that the new policy has a CTR that blows the previous observed CTRs out of the water. The maximum CTR reached is about 43%. Even with more aligned time steps, the policy was much more effective as shown by its CTR of 30% even at the comparable time step of t = 1000. Also observed is that we do observe a similar plateau in CTR growth rate from t = 200 to 700, where the policy is exploring different arms due to the similar levels of uncertainty. Once the policy learnt enough, the rewards rate shot up dramatically thereafter.</p>

<h1 id="beyond-linucb-disjoint">Beyond LinUCB Disjoint</h1>

<p>Coming to the end of this, I showed that the use of contextual bandits makes more sense if you have access to more granular information that might help predict the effectiveness of recommendations. LinUCB Disjoint is only one of many contextual bandit algorithms. The next variant of a linear contextual bandit is called LinUCB Hybrid which was also covered in the same paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0146">“A Contextual-Bandit Approach to Personalized News Article Recommendation”</a> by Li et al.</p>

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/post_11/paper_hybrid_eqn.png" /> 
</div>

<p>The hybrid model has an additional feature term <code class="highlighter-rouge">z_t</code>, which comprises of shared features across various arms. According to the paper, <code class="highlighter-rouge">z_t</code> is the feature of the current user/article combina-
tion while <code class="highlighter-rouge">β*</code> is an unknown coefficient vector common to all arms. I will not cover that in this article but I will probably do it in a separate article.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>In summary, I have illustrated the difference between multi-armed bandits and contextual bandits. Building off the concept of the UCB algorithm that is prevalent in the MAB realm, I illustrated the intuition behind the linear UCB contextual bandit, where the payoff is assumed to be a linear function of the context features. This was also done with a simulation experiment of a LinUCB policy with varying <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> values, and we observed the impact of the online learning.</p>

<p>The Jupyer notebook that has the relevant code for LinUCB Disjoint implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/kfoofw/bandit_simulations/blob/master/python/contextual_bandits/notebooks/LinUCB_disjoint.ipynb">here</a>.
