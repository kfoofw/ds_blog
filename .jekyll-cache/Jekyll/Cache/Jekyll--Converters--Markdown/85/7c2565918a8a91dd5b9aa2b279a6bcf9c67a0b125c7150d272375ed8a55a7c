I"Ä<p>With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of quarantine and social distancing by various governments created a ripple of effects that affect cities all around the world. The key driver behind this was the halting of economic activity which brought about a big crunch in the global economy. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the media reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-coronavirus.html">the carbon emissions in China was reduced drastically</a> in mid Feb 2020. This gave me an idea as I wanted to try out some time series analysis on air quality in certain cities with the implementation of a city-wide quarantine measure.</p>
