I"2<p>The Epsilon Greedy algorithm is one of the key algorithms behind decision sciences, and embodies the balance of exploration versus exploitation. The dilemma between exploration versus exploitation can be defined simply based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exploitation: Based on what you know of the circumstances, choose the option/action that has the best average return.</li>
  <li>Exploration: Recognise that what you know of the different options may be limited, and choose to engage in options that may potentially reveal themselves to be of high return</li>
</ul>
