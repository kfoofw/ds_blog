I"‰Q<p>With the data from the ESPN NBA website for the regular NBA season of
2018-2019, I will try to model Bayesian Hierarchical modelling to find
out the 3 point percentages across the different basketball positions.</p>

<p>The ESPN dataset comprises of players stats with player position
assignment as listed in the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PG: Point Guard</li>
  <li>SG: Shooting Guard</li>
  <li>G: Guard (probably for players who can play both PG and SG)</li>
  <li>SF: Small Forward</li>
  <li>PF: Power Forward</li>
  <li>F: Forward (probably for players who can play both SF and PF)</li>
  <li>C: Center</li>
</ul>

<p>Each act of 3 point shooting is a dichotomous action: for every attempt
taken, either the player hits it, or misses it. This can be viewed as a
Bernoulli distribution, with the probability of success represented by
theta Œ∏. Thus, every player has his individual Œ∏, and across many
repeated 3 point attempts, the collection of 3 points shots made out of
N attempts becomes a Binomial distribution based on the player‚Äôs Œ∏ and
the number of attempts he makes N.</p>

<h2 id="simple-modelling">Simple Modelling</h2>

<p>Consider the base case in which every player can be treated as an
individual with a 3 point shooting skill set. As with any typical
statistical population distribution, there are players with excellent 3
point shooting skills (and thus they have high Œ∏), while there are
players with poor 3 point shooting skills (and thus a low Œ∏).</p>

<p>This can be represented by the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP%28%5Ctheta%7CY%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BP%28Y%20%7C%20%5Ctheta%29%20P%28%5Ctheta%29%7D%7BP%28Y%29%7D%0A" alt="

" title="

" /></p>

<p>where Y is the data, theta is the parameter of the Bernoulli
distribution.</p>

    Rule,</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="simplenaive-bayesian-hierarchical-bh-modelling">Simple/Naive Bayesian Hierarchical (BH) Modelling</h2>

<p>We can also have the notion that the skills of all players come from a
common distribution as parameterised by omega œâ. This is akin to saying
that we can generate all NBA players‚Äô Œ∏ from an overarching
distribution.</p>

<p>Formally, in addition to each player‚Äôs 3 point shooting prowess
represented by Œ∏, we can integrate another parameter omega œâ into the BH
model, where œâ parameterises the skillset distributions for different
positions.</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP%28%5Ctheta%2C%20%5Comega%7CY%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BP%28Y%20%7C%20%5Ctheta%2C%20%5Comega%29%20P%28%5Ctheta%2C%20%5Comega%29%7D%7BP%28Y%29%7D%0A" alt="
P(\theta, \omega|Y) = \frac{P(Y | \theta, \omega) P(\theta,
\omega)}{P(Y)}
" title="
P(\\theta, \\omega|Y) = \\frac{P(Y | \\theta, \\omega) P(\\theta, \\omega)}{P(Y)}
" /></p>

<p>Given that theta is conditional upon omega, we can perform Markov
factorisation for the conditional relationship between tehta and omega.
Thus, the numerator can be represented by the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP%28Y%20%7C%20%5Ctheta%2C%20%5Comega%29%20P%28%5Ctheta%2C%20%5Comega%29%20%3D%20P%28Y%20%7C%20%5Ctheta%29%20P%28%5Ctheta%20%7C%20%5Comega%29%20P%28%5Comega%29%0A" alt="
P(Y | \theta, \omega) P(\theta, \omega) = P(Y | \theta) P(\theta |
\omega) P(\omega)
" title="
P(Y | \\theta, \\omega) P(\\theta, \\omega) = P(Y | \\theta) P(\\theta | \\omega) P(\\omega)
" /><br />
Thus, the overall posterior can be represented by the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP%28%5Ctheta%2C%20%5Comega%7CY%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BP%28Y%20%7C%20%5Ctheta%29%20P%28%5Ctheta%20%7C%20%5Comega%29%20P%28%5Comega%29%7D%7BP%28Y%29%7D%0A" alt="
P(\theta, \omega|Y) = \frac{P(Y | \theta) P(\theta | \omega)
P(\omega)}{P(Y)}
" title="
P(\\theta, \\omega|Y) = \\frac{P(Y | \\theta) P(\\theta | \\omega) P(\\omega)}{P(Y)}
" /><br />
where in this case, omega serves as a kind of prior belief for the
distribution of theta.</p>

<h2 id="bayesian-hierarchical-bh-modelling-of-nba-positions">Bayesian Hierarchical (BH) Modelling of NBA Positions</h2>

<p>Different positions will have different skillsets but within each
position, players tend to have similar skillsets. This gives us the
premise for constructing the Bayesian Hierarchical model.</p>

<p>To help facilitate this train of thought, it is natural to think that
PGs tend to have better 3 point shooting skills compared to Centers.
Consequently, consider an omega œâ_pg that parameterises the
distribution of Œ∏_pg for all PGs, while consider a separate omega œâ_c
that parameterises the distribution of Œ∏_c for all centers. This
segmentation of omegas for different positions helps in generating more
accurate thetas for the relevant positions since the intra-group
properties are not ‚Äúcross-contaminated‚Äù or diluted. This can be seen by
the following formulation:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AP%28%5Ctheta%2C%20%5Comega_%7Bpos%7D%7CY%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BP%28Y%20%7C%20%5Ctheta%29%20P%28%5Ctheta%20%7C%20%5Comega_%7Bpos%7D%29%20P%28%5Comega_%7Bpos%7D%29%7D%7BP%28Y%29%7D%0A" alt="

<h2 id="choice-of-distributions-for-bh-model">Choice of Distributions for BH Model</h2>

<p>Before we proceed, we need to define the distributions to be
incorporated into the BH modelling. For this example, we will utilise
the following distributions: * Bernoulli distribution + Parameterised

<ul>

<p>To create the model syntax for the distributions, we need to incorporate
the distributions into the finalised posterior representation as shown:</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that priors are set to be typically
vague/non-commital unless one has defined knowledge in the particular

<h2 id="simulation-results">Simulation Results</h2>

<p>Using modified scripts from the ‚ÄúDoing Bayesian Data Analysis‚Äù to run
MCMC simulations on JAGS, we have the following results. 3 MCMC chains
with separate initial points were simulated with 500 steps burn-in, and
thinning in 100-steps intervals to reduce auto-correlation.</p>

<h3 id="overall-distribution-for-omega">Overall Distribution for Omega</h3>

<p>The parameter ‚ÄúomegaO‚Äù represents the overall prior Beta distribution
from which the omega_pos parameters are generated. * The top right
graph show that there is a moderate effective sample size (ESS) of 4802.
The rule of thumb should be around at least 10,000 in order for the high
density intervals (HDI) quantile limits to be trusted, but at above
3000, the estimated mean/mode of the distribution is still reliable. *
The top left graph shows the exploration of the 3 MCMC chains across the
parameter spectrum, and we can observe that the chains did sufficient
exploration (remember that omega is from a Beta distribution of limits 0
and 1). * The bottom left chart depicts the Gelman plot, which is a
diagnostic for comparing the variance across chains against the variance
within each chain. Basically, the Gelman-Rubin measures a value called
‚Äúscale reduction factor‚Äù that represents if there is a significant
difference between the variance within several chains and the variance
between several chains. If the scale factor is above 1.1, it shows that
some of the MCMC chains might have gotten stuck and may not have
converged correctly. In our case, the scale factors are close to 1.0,
which indicates convergence of the chains. * The bottom right chart
depicts the density chart for each chains. Since all chains have similar
densities, we can deduce that the simulations corroborated each other.
The stated MCSE represents the estimated SD of the sample mean in the
chain, on the scale of the parameter value. Since MCSE is small, the
standard deviation of the simulations estimates are ok in this
case.</p>

<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_4/ThreePointers-DiagomegaO.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<h3 id="positional-based-omega-distributions">Positional-Based Omega Distributions</h3>

<p>For the parameter ‚Äúomega[x]‚Äù where x is the index for each position
grouping, it represents the position grouping parameter that is
generated from ‚ÄúomegaO‚Äù. The following plot compiles all the generated
probabilitiy distribution for each position‚Äôs omega, where omega[1]
represents the mode for the beta distribution for Centers and omega[7]
represents the mode for the beta distribution for Shooting Guards. The
95% (default) HDI of each distribution is shown, but unfortunately for
certain positions, the distributions are so narrow that the superimposed
text ‚Äúblocks‚Äù each other out (for example as seen in omega[7]
SG).</p>

<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_4/ThreePointers-Omega.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<p>As expected, big men roles such as Centers and Forwards do have much
poorer 3 point shooting accuracy in general compared to backcourt roles
such as Point Guards or Shooting Guards. This can be seen from the modes
of the distributions. Additionally, Centers and Forwards also have a
much wider variance in their distributions compared to PGs/SGs. We know
this to be true when there are players such as Karl-Anthony Towns or
Kevin Love who have exceptional 3 point shooting abilities, while there
are other centers such as Rudy Gorbert or Deandre Jordan who do not have
that touch.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Power Forward roles seem to have an exceptional 3 point
shooting percentages. Upon inspection of the data, players such as
Pascal Siakam and Danilo Gallinari are included. There are some PFs who
do have poor 3 point shooting percentages, but those who have poor
shooting tend to takes less shots in total. This can explain the ‚Äúshift‚Äù
towards a higher than expected 3 point shooting percentage for this
position.</p>

<p>Another interesting discovery is that for the G position, the mode of
the distribution is actually lower than that of PFs.</p>

<h3 id="difference-in-positional-omegas">Difference in Positional Omegas</h3>

<p>We can also determine the difference in omega values for the different
positions.</p>

<p>A simple comparion between Center and PG positions is shown below. The
plots on the top left and bottom right shows the histogram distributions
for each position‚Äôs omega values, while the plot on the top right shows
the simulated difference. We can see that for (C - PG), the mode of the
difference is -0.084. However, this is insufficient for us to conclude
that there is a significant difference. To do that, we rely on the HDI
intervals of the histogram. Reading off the plot tells us that 99.7% of
the histogram lies below 0, while only 0.3% lies above. Similarly the
95% HDI upper limit is at -0.0126. Thus, we can conclude that there is a
significant difference between the 3 point shooting percentages of C
versus PGs.</p>

<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_4/ThreePointers-OmegaDiff3.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<p>We can do a similar comparison for PF vs G positions. Note that we
previously encountered that PFs have a surprisingly good 3 point
shooting percentage, and also that Gs have a lower shooting percentage
than PFs. As shown in the top right plot, the key value of 0 lies
between the 95% HDI credible interval limits of the difference in
positional omegas. Thus we cannot conclude that there is a difference
between the 3 point shooting percentage of PFs versus Gs.</p>

<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_4/ThreePointers-OmegaDiff5.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<h3 id="individual-players-theta-comparison">Individual Player‚Äôs Theta Comparison</h3>

<p>We can also find out player specific performances. Comparing two elite
players in different positions (James Harden versus Karl-Anthony Towns),
we now observe that in all of the histogram plots there is a red cross.
This red cross represents the original individual player data without
consideration of the hierarchy of positions. For example, we see that
for Karl-Anthony Towns, his individual percentage is 139/354 = 39.27%.
The mode of his theta histogram which is shown to be at 38.8% which is
relatively lower. This is because there is ‚Äúshrinkage‚Äù due to the
positional information incorporated into the BH modelling, where Centers
have much poorer shooting percentages at 26.9%.</p>

<p>This shrinkage effect is not as evident in James Harden, whose actual 3
point shooting percentage was 374/1030 = 36.3% compared to the
positional mode value of 36.6%.</p>

<p align="center">
&lt;img src=/assets/img/post_4/ThreePointers-ThetaDiff1.png /img&gt; 
</p>

<p>It is worth highlighting that the term ‚Äúshrinkage‚Äù may be interpreted
wrongly. It does not always mean that the value estimated is reduced. In
fact it works both ways. For those who have individual modes that are
below the positional/group mode value, it will increase their estimated
individual mode. Vice versa for those with individual modes above the
position/group mode values. The concept of ‚Äúshrinkage‚Äù applies in terms
of shrinking towards the group value.</p>

<p>This can be further illustrated by the comparison between Stephen Curry
and Jusuf Nurkic. Stephen Curry has an shooting percentage of 352/807 =
43.6% which is way above the positional PG mode of 35.7%. This brings
his estimated shooting percentage to 41.8%. On the other hand, Jusuf
Nurkic has made 0 out of 29 attempts, but based on the positional
information (mode = 26.9%), his estimated shooting percentage is 6.18%.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this analysis, I have demonstrated the application of Bayesian
Hierarchical modelling with NBA positional information for 3 point
shooting percentages. We also went through some diagnosis of MCMC
simulations, and how to verify that the simulations are reliable.
Additionally, we went through some analysis of the shooting percentages
for each position and for certain players. With hiearchical modelling
came a key concept of ‚Äúshrinkage‚Äù, which was also illustrated when we
compare players within each position and how the positional information
impacted their estimated shooting percentages.</p>
