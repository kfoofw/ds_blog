I"»;<p>Moving beyond the Epsilon Greedy algorithm, the Softmax algorithm provides further optimisation in terms of enhancing the chance of rewards during exploration.</p>

<p>To get a better intuition, consider the following two cases of 2 Bernoulli arms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first arm has 0.1 reward average while the other has 0.9 reward average.</li>
  <li>The first arm has 0.1 reward average while the other has 0.11 reward average.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Epsilon Greedy in both cases, for a specified epsilon percentage of exploration trials, the algorithm will choose randomly between both arms in both situations regardless of how different the average rewards between both arms are.</p>

<p>Therein lies the opportunity for an optimized solution that the Softmax algorithm can provide. For any given round, instead of uniformly exploring all arms, it provides arms of different chance of being interacted with based on the difference in their current reward averages.</p>

<p>In summary, the Softmax proposes the following probability distribution of choosing each arm at each given round:</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/post_7/softmax_eqn.png" /> 
</p>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">r_i</code> represents the current reward return average of each arm at the current round.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> parameter is a hyperparameter that ultimately determines how much randomisation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> is large, the overall exponential element of all arms approach a resultant value of 1, and thus the chance of exploring any specific arm is 1.</li>
  <li>When <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> is small, the overall exponential element of each arm is exponentially proportional to their current return, and thus, arms with higher average return will have a higher chance of being chosen in the exploration phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that the structured exploration of the Softmax algorithm combines aspects of exploitation and exploration. Instead of segmenting the trials into exploration and exploitation phases, the Softmax incorporates exploitation by using it to increase the chance of picking the higher return arm, while also yet making it also possible to pick the lower return arm (which is some form of exploration).</p>

<p>The following analysis is based on the book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/bandit-algorithms-for/9781449341565/">‚ÄúBandit Algorithms for Website Optimization‚Äù</a> by John Myles White. For further understanding of the code, I have included comments for easier understanding.</p>

<p>Below is the code for creation of the SoftMax algorithm setup and progressive updates of counts and values for arms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Counts: Represent recorded times when arm was pulled.</li>
  <li>Values: Represent the known mean reward. In the case of a Bernoulli arm, values represent the probability of reward which ranges from 0 to 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>As per previous discussion in the Epsilon Greedy article, we will use a Bernoulli distribution to represent the reward function of each arm.</p>

<p>To proceed with any further analysis, an operational script is required to process the simulation. The following code helps to create a simulation for a specific run of epsilon value.</p>

  <li>horizon: Represents the number of time steps/trials per round of simulation</li>

<h2 id="simulation-of-arms-with-relatively-big-differences-in-means">Simulation of Arms with relatively big differences in Means</h2>
<p>Similar to what was done previously in the analysis for Epsilon-greedy, the simulation comprises of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create 5 arms, four of which have average reward of 0.1, and the last/best has average reward of 0.9.</li>
  <li>Save simulation output to a tab-separated file</li>
  <li>Create 5000 independent simulations for each <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value for a total of 5 epsilon values ranging from 0.1 to 0.5.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice for 5000 independent simulations is because we want to determine the average performance. Each simulation might be subject to the stochastic nature/run and the performances might be skewed due to random chance. Thus it is important to run a reasonably high number of simulations to evaluate the average mean/performance.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import random

# Shuffling arms
random.shuffle(means)

# Create list of Bernoulli Arms with Reward Information
arms = list(map(lambda mu: BernoulliArm(mu), means))
print("Best arm is " + str(np.argmax(means)))

<p>Using some data-preprocessing and basic Altair visualisation, we can plot the probability of pulling the best arm for each epsilon value.</p>

</p>

<p>For different values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code>, there are different asymptotic limits to the eventual rate of chooosing the best arm. As mentioned previously, the higher the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code>, the higher degree of randomisation in picking arms which explains the asymptotes. For a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value of 0.1, it does seem to eventually converge close to 1.</p>

<p>The rate of convergence towards their corresponding asymptotes seem to be similar for all values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code>, except for 0.1 which seems to take about twice as long as the rest. From an inverted perspective of reaching convergence, it seems that there is some manner of exponential decay towards the asymptote as shown by the nearly similar gradients at the start (from time steps between 0 to 10).</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/post_7/cum-reward_5-arms_0dot1-0dot9_soft.png" /> 
</p>

<p>Looking at the cumulative reward system, there is a stark difference of the Softmax algorithm compared to the Epsilon Greedy algorithm. We saw that for the Epsilon Greedy algorithm simulation, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">epsilon</code> value of 0.1 had to play catchup since it was not exploring enough in the early stage of the experiment to discover the best arm. Thus, its cumulative return was below that of other <code class="highlighter-rouge">epsilon</code> values for a large portion of the 250 time steps period.</p>

<p>For the Softmax algorithm, we see that its algorithm provides sufficient exploration amidst exploitation. Thus, lower values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> remained constantly higher in terms of cumulative reward. This is intuitive as the lower the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code>, the lower the degree of randomised exploration. Thus, there is a lower degree of picking poorer return arms.</p>

<p>It must also be noted that for Epsilon Greedy, the cumulative reward values ranged between 140 to 180. In this case, Softmax <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> values of 0.1 and 0.2 are able to reach cumulative reward range of 200 to 220, which means they constantly exploited the best arm and did so quite early on.</p>

<h2 id="simulation-of-arms-with-relatively-smaller-differences-in-means">Simulation of Arms with relatively smaller differences in Means</h2>

<p>The previous analysis was a simulation exercise on arms with big differences in reward returns. We extend the analysis to a situation where the arms are relatively closer.</p>

<p>In the following case, we simulate 5 arms, 4 of which have a mean of 0.8 while the last/best has a mean of 0.9.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/post_7/rate-best-arm_5-arms_0dot8-0dot9_soft.png" /> 
</p>

<p>With the reward returns of arms being much closer now, we see a big deterioration in the performance of the Softmax algorithm. The rate of choosing the best arm now ranges between 0.22 to 0.32. It is interesting to observe that a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value of 0.2 has an asymptote of 0.32, while a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value of 0.1 has an asymptote of 0.25 (which is similar to that of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value 0.4).</p>

<p>This seems to imply that the reduced difference in reward function makes it harder to determine which is the best arm especially with respect to <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value 0.1. In fact, for a higher degree of randomisation represented by a higher <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value 0.2 (or even 0.3), we obtain better rates of selecting the best arm.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in this scenario, for Epsilon Greedy algorithm, the rate of choosing the best arm is actually higher as represented by the ranges of 0.5 to 0.7, compared to the Softmax algorithm range of 0.22 to 0.32. This seems to imply that Epsilon Greedy might be better suited for multi-armed based situations where the difference in means are much smaller.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/post_7/cum-reward_5-arms_0dot8-0dot9_soft.png" /> 
</p>

<p>Similar to what we saw in the Epsilon Greedy analysis, the cumulative rewards for all <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> values are much closer in nature so much so that they are indistinguishable. Likewise, this is probably due to the fact that the reward means of all arms are quite close.</p>

<p>Since the arms are close in average returns, it will be more interesting to verify the overall cumulative regret.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/post_7/cum-regret_5-arms_0dot8-0dot9_soft.png" /> 
</p>

<p>Based on the cumulative regret plots, we see that <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value of 0.2 is the best at around 15.5 while <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> value of 0.5 is the worst at 19.2. On a whole, the Softmax algorithm is worst off compared to the Epsilon Greedy algorithm which had a range of 12.3 to 14.8. For the better performing <code class="highlighter-rouge">tau</code> values, there is a tapering off in the plots but as a whole, the Softmax algorithm does seem to fare worser than Epsilon Greedy.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this analysis of Softmax algorithm, we covered the algorithmic intuition as well as the experimental results of applying the Softmax algorithm. The results were benchmarked against the Epsilon Greedy algorithm which was covered previously.</p>

<p>A learning takeaway is that for arms with closer means, the Softmax algorithm does not seem to be as robust in terms of determining the best arm, for which Epsilon Greedy is more suitable.</p>
